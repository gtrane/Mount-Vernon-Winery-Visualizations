#### Summary
I utilized Tableau to visualize sales data from 2019 - 2020 for a Mt Vernon Winery (the data itself was provided by my professor, and does not reflect actual sales data). In group project 1, I analyzed the data in order to provide new marketing strategies, as the company saw sales decrease in 2020. In group project 2, I implimented the use of Tableau dashboards and storyboards to tell a story with the data, providing analytics on the company's successes and growth opportunities.

My work included:
- Excel data massaging
- Tableau calculated fields
- Tableau animations (bar-chart race)
- Tableau dashboard & storyboards
